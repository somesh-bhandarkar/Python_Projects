# This program is written as a project for the course ENPM697
##
# The program uses z3 SMT solver https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
#
# The sum will look something like this
#
#		 00000000000
#        01234567890
#		 02-width--0
#		 03 l      0
#		 04 e      0
#		 05 n      0
#		 06 g      0
#		 07 t      0
#		 08 h      0
#		 09		   0
#		 00000000000
#  
#	The 0 is where the border is and the value inside it will
#   always be 0, as there is no possibility of a mine being there
#
# The program uses a binary 0/1 approach for the mine placement
# The program uses a list of list/matrix entry to store the boolean
# The main unknown here is whether there is a mine in the unknown grid
# I have solved this problem by feeding constraints to the SMT Solver
# and checking satisfiability
#
